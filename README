This project was created as a way for me to use Ruby and apply the
various concepts that I'd read about but not used. So far Ruby is looking
awesome :)

The idea of the FishTank is that there are various types of fish. Each has a
different behavior and in each "tick" or iteration they swim, eat and maybe die.
This has allowed me to try out a surprising amount of concept that make Ruby.

To try it out just run `ruby test.rb`
